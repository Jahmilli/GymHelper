## Flow of app
1. You're reminded to go the gym at a certain time
2. You get to the gym and you see it is (push/pull/legs) and you press start workout.
3. It shows bench press (push example), a weight and reps. You do the set, and click either '-' to reduce reps completed, 'OK' to say you did exactly those reps or '+' to add more reps.
4. Once submitted it shows the rest time to the next set as well as the weight, reps etc for the next set. Also shows a counter of how many sets left.
5. Once you have completed all sets it moves to the next exercise and repeats steps 3-4.
6. Finish workout and it shows details of the workout (prs, highlights etc). Also records end time.

## Viewing progress of workouts
We can view graphs that display when you've gone to the gym, whether you've been progressing over time in terms of strength, body fat whatever
When you've been achieving PRs, times of best workouts to find a relation etc.
